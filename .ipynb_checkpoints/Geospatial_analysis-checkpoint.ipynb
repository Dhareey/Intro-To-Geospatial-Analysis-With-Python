For example, A building (depending on map scale) can be represented by a point, a road can be represented with line and a large expanse of land can be represented by a Polygon. These 3 Objects are the 3 major Objects in Shapely as well. So we will go through them, how they are created, and well, objects in python has methods so we will examine the basic methods as well."
